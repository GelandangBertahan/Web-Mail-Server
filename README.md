# Web-Mail-Server
a web mail server using Roundcube for a company. soon, i'll add some new features cloud storage with Nextcloud



# Requirement:
1. LAMP stack 
   The Linux i use is Ubuntu Server 20.04, Apache2, MySQL(sorry i forgot my mysql version), and PHP version 7.4. LAMP stack can be installed using docker, but for now i just using conventional method. here apache can be replace with Nginx and MySQL can be replaced by MariaDB
2. Roundcube. https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases
3. and many more software 


# Progress:
- install LAMP stack and Roundcube âœ…
- add extension for php (some extension must installed manually, and get error cause php7.4 is too oldðŸ™ƒ)
